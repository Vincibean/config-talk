*"Traditionally, programmers have used the telescoping constructor pattern, in
which you provide a constructor with only the required parameters, another with a
single optional parameter, a third with two optional parameters, and so on, culminating
in a constructor with all the optional parameters."*

*Joshua Bloch*
