*"PureConfig is a Scala library for loading configuration files. It reads Typesafe Config configurations written in HOCON, Java .properties, or JSON to native Scala classes in a boilerplate-free way. Sealed traits, case classes, collections, optional values, and many other types are all supported out-of-the-box."*
