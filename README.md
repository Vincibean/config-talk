# This Is Not The Configuration Talk You Are Looking For
## Synopsis
Reading from a configuration file is one of the tasks that every developer has to face sooner or later; most of us are so used to it that we give it for granted. 
During this talk we will introduce a particularly nested and complex configuration example, and then we will explore different approaches for reading it, assessing the pros and cons of each of them. 
It will also be a good opportunity for exploring the different techniques that can be used in Scala.
